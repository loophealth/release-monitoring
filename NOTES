A release has the following states and actions
1. Create a release from main and deploy to 'QA' environment
2. The release goes through rigorous testing and if there are any bugs users can block the release and we need to capture this state
3. Users are allowed to comment on the release to dictate any failing things or comments they have
4. Developers fix the bugs and collect the commits as a hotfix to the release which updates the 'QA' environment with the new build again
5. It also updates the state to be ready for testing
6. In case there are no more bugs we need "approvals" from 2 users minimum to indicate that we can "promote" the build to the next stage.
7. On a "promote" action we deploy the build to "beta" environment , the same process follows again until we reach "production"
8. Once on production we still need 2 approvals to close the release as stable
